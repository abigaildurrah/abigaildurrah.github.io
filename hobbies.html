			I love to knit! My Freshman year of college I really started getting into it and
			have since learned many different ways to knit. I have created so many beautiful 
			scarves, mittens, hats, and blankets that I have run out of people to gift them to.
			My best friend from my hometown and I get together a couple of times a week and
			knit while catching up. At the end of each year, we donate everything we've made
			local children's hospitals and other charities in the area.

			Ever since I was little I have always had a desire to travel. My parents are two people
			who have always spent their extra money on vacations. In 18 years of life I have
			visited Disney World more times than I can count, every state in New England,
			Mexico, New York City, New Jersey, and many other locations outside of the United
			States.
