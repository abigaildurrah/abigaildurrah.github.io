			My favorite book of all time is Firefly Lane by Kristin Hannah. It follows two
			best friends through their journey of growing up, growing apart, and once again 
			finding each other and rekindling their strong bond. Their friendship started
			when Tully Hart comes to Kate Mularkey's rescue and pulls her up from the bottom 
			of the 8<sup>th</sup> grade food chain. This book is one of my favorites because
			it mirrors my experience growing up on the same street as my best friend, growing 
			apart, and finding our way back to each other.

		<p>
			Another great read is written by Jodi Picoult titled Nineteen Minutes. This story follows
			a superior court judge named Alex, Josie, and Peter's parents. Each of these
			characters play an important role in finding out what happened the day of the school
			shooting. Alex is torn between presiding over the biggest case of her career 
			and knowing that doing so will cause an even wider chasm in her relationship 
			with her emotionally fragile daughter who was inside of the school on that terrible
			day. While Josie, Peter's best friend claims she can’t remember what happened 
			in the last fatal minutes of Peter’s rampage. And Peter’s parents, Lacy and Lewis 
			Houghton who ceaselessly examine the past to see what they might have said or 
			done to compel their son to such extremes. This book is riveting and feels so real
			that you feel as though you have become a part of the story with every turn of 
			the page.
